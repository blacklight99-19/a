My quilling journey started long time back when I was at my cousinâ€™s house. I was 5 and my sister introduced me to quilling. She taught me the basics of quilling, and I found it interesting!!
A few days later when I came back home I asked my mom if she could buy a quilling set for me.
She said yes, so she took me to the fancy store. The man showed us 2 sets one was big and the other was small. I pleaded my mom for the big one, which she finally got for me. I showed it to my friends near my home and they got quilling sets too. We all sat together and made quilling earrings, talked, laughed, sang and other stuff. I got better and better at quilling. One day I suddenly lost interest so I stopped.
