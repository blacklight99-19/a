I am Shikha, born in 2007, and a self designed learner. When I was 10, I stopped going to school and started exploring my interests. School was awesome, but being a self designed learner, I got the time and space to really explore my interests and passion. Currently my interests are odissi dance, cubing, playing the ocarina, making jewelry, singing, acting and swimming.
I love exploring and push myself towards challenging things.
My most recent interest is in running and I am training for an opportunity to run a marathon. And I also love animals!!!
